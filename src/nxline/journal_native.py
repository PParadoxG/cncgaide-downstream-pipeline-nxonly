"""Asking NX the standard question.  Runs under ``run_journal.exe`` only.

One Parametric round with the Find Features dialog's factory defaults, and
whatever comes back is what is recorded.  Every setting below was checked
against the dialog item by item, so the recipe can be restated in one table:

    RecognitionType          Parametric      (the dialog's Type, default)
    rounds                   1               (the dialog runs one)
    GeometrySearchType       AllGeometry     (the dialog's Search Method)
    feature types            all registered  (the dialog's list, all ticked)
    MapFeatures              False           (the dialog's box, unticked)
    machining access dir.    not set         (the dialog's Method = None)
    limit search area        not set         (the dialog's Select Face = 0)
    AssignColor              not set
    AddCadFeatureAttributes  not set

Nothing is added to the dialog's question: one round, no extra recognition
type, no flag the dialog does not offer.  Anything a GUI user cannot ask for
would make the answer something other than NX's own.

Attributes are **enumerated**, not probed.  ``CAMFeature.Attributes`` is the
collection behind the Machining Feature Navigator's tooltip, and it hands over
every attribute NX carries on the feature, so the installation schema
(``customization_base.xml``) never has to be parsed to guess a candidate list.
What the enumeration cannot read is recorded by name and reason rather than
defaulted - which is how the ``FACES_*`` and ``CHAMFER`` slots stay visible as
gaps instead of disappearing.
