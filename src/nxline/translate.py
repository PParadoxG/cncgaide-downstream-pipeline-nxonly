"""STEP -> .prt via NX's standalone translator.

``step242.exe`` is the only working batch route: the NXOpen
``Step242Importer.Commit()`` crashes with a memory access violation under
batch, so translation happens out of process, one CLI call per part.
Translation is cached by content: a ``.prt`` is reused when the recorded
source sha256 matches, so a re-run without source changes costs nothing.

The translator writes a log of its own.  Left to itself it drops
``step242ug.log`` into whatever directory the pipeline happened to be started
from, so it is given both a working directory and a name: the log lands beside
the ``.prt`` it belongs to and a failure can point at it.
