"""Where NX lives, and how to talk to it.

Where the install *is* comes from :mod:`nx_location` - environment variable,
then ``config/nx_local.json``, then the built-in default.  The licence server
has no grace period: both CLIs fail in ~7 seconds when it cannot be reached,
which doubles as the liveness probe.

``NX_ROOT`` and the three paths under it are resolved **on every read**, not
frozen when this module is first imported.  A run that starts after
``config/nx_local.json`` was written, or a process that sets the environment
variable before asking, has to get the answer that is true now; an
import-time snapshot would make the answer depend on which module happened to
be imported first.  They stay spelled as module attributes because that is how
every reader already asks.
