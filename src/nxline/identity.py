"""How faces, edges and vertices are numbered.

The ids are ordinals (``face_<i>``), so *what order the entities are put in*
is what makes a part reproducible.  The NX tag order will not do: a tag
reflects how many objects the session had already loaded, so opening one .prt
in a batch and opening it alone hand back two different tag orderings for the
same solid, and every id would move while the solid did not.

``uf.Tag.AskHandleOfTag`` returns NX's persistent object handle
(``RMPart_6.prt R0000028f00000022``) instead, and it holds on all three axes
the pipeline needs:

* stable across sessions (58/58 faces, 147/147 edges of ``stc_cad_rsb``,
  where the tag moved on every single one);
* stable across *session composition* - batch and single agree;
* stable across re-translation (j23b: the same STEP through a fresh
  ``step242`` run keeps every handle), so clearing the ``.prt`` cache does not
  shuffle the ids either.

The handle is the sort key, not the id: what the file publishes is still the
same dense ``face_<i>`` numbering, so nothing downstream changes shape.

**Never the tag.**  When handles are missing or not unique the fallback is a
geometric canonical key - quantized to a fixed number of decimals and
tie-broken by further fields - and the degradation is *named* in the model's
``normalization_log`` rather than silently taken.  Falling back to the tag
would reintroduce exactly the defect this module exists to remove.

Nothing here touches NX: ``assign_identity`` is a pure function of plain
records, which is what lets a test shuffle its input and demand the same
answer without a licence.
