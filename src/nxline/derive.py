"""The derived block of a feature node: what the kernel measured about it.

A node's top level stays pure NX (name and value exactly as published), and
anything the *pipeline* measured about the feature goes in a separate
``derived`` block, one entry per quantity, each carrying
``derivedBy: nx_kernel``.  ``source/derived.yaml`` declares the quantities;
this module materialises them, inside the journal process where the kernel is
alive, so that a later rerun of the rules needs no NX session.

Which nodes are owed a measurement is the ontology's answer, not this
module's: a quantity's domain is the union of the ``applies_to`` patterns of
the heuristics that read it (``derived_domain``).  Widening a domain in the
YAML therefore *declares* a debt this code only repays on the next full
rebuild of the part — until then the evaluation gate reports the missing
measurement as a named NOT_EVALUABLE, which is the honest state.

Refusal is a first-class answer everywhere: no axis, no floor face, no
kernel, or the kernel's own ``None`` each produce an entry whose ``value`` is
null and whose ``reason`` names the gap, so a verdict downstream can say
exactly why it could not be reached.
