"""NX's native feature-based recognition, projected onto feature nodes.

There is no translation step here.  NX's answer *is* the answer:

* the class is NX's ``Type`` (``STEP1HOLE``) - stable, unique, and unlike the
  display name it does not move when the NX interface language does;
* the label is NX's ``TypeDisplayName`` (``Through Hole``) - the exact string
  the Machining Feature Navigator shows, carried for every place a human
  reads;
* the attributes are NX's attributes, under NX's own names, with NX's own
  values.  Nothing is renamed, converted, re-derived or re-measured.

What this module adds is *reading*, never data.  The enumerated attributes
fall into four piles, and three of them are not measurements - rule defaults
out of ISO 2768-1 class m, annotation sub-fields, identity flags, and slots
that read ``0`` because they are unused rather than because something was
measured as zero.  Every value is still published verbatim; which pile it
belongs to is recorded beside it so a reader never mistakes a table lookup for
a measurement.

Nothing here imports NX.  The journal hands over plain records and the
geometry provider's ``tag -> face id`` table; everything below is a pure
function of those, which is what lets it be tested without a licence.
