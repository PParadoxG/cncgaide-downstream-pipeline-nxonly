"""PartModel normalization: seam-face merging and axial-extent annotation.

Pure ``PartModel`` data operations, which is why they live in ``contract``
rather than beside the kernel that filled the table.  NX's translator already
sews seams, so the merge pass rarely finds anything to do; the axial-extent
annotation is load-bearing.

The merge is **topology-preserving**: when two seam-split fragments of one
surface are merged, every non-seam boundary edge of the removed face survives
as part of the merged keeper face (reconstructed closed loops, rebuilt
adjacency).  Only the internal seam boundary shared by the two fragments may
disappear.  If the surviving boundary cannot be reconstructed into closed
loops, the merge is conservatively skipped and the model is left untouched.

    **This function consumes its argument.**  It rewrites *model* and returns
    the very same object; the caller must treat the pre-merge model as gone
    the moment the call is made.  The call site in ``nxline.partmodel`` writes
    ``model = normalize_seam_faces(model)`` and drops the pre-merge object; a
    caller that does want to keep it passes ``copy.deepcopy(model)`` itself,
    rather than paying for a deep copy on every part.

    **Merge conditions**:

    1. The two faces are mutually adjacent.
    2. They share the same ``SurfaceType``.
    3. Their key geometric parameters match within tolerance (see
       ``_params_match``).
    4. Cylinders use a shared ``is_seam = True`` edge. Cones use a
       ``SMOOTH`` cone-cone adjacency on the same axis line because the
       STEP parser often does not mark those smooth split edges as seams.

    **Merge operation** (dataclass level only, per DC3):

    - Retain the ``FaceData`` with larger area; discard the other.
    - Redirect all adjacency references to the discarded face so they
      point to the retained face.
    - Remove *only* the internal seam edges that connected the two faces
      from ``edges`` and ``ShellData.edge_ids``.  Non-seam boundary edges
      of the discarded face are kept and spliced into the retained face's
      reconstructed loops.
    - Rebuild the retained face's ``LoopData`` from the surviving boundary
      edge connectivity (closed cycles; preserved inner loops).
    - Rebuild the retained face's adjacency list as the union of both
      faces' third-party adjacencies (reciprocal, deduplicated).
    - Append the discarded face ID to the retained face's
      ``merged_from`` list.
    - Preserve the discarded face area in merge provenance.
    - Log every merge (and every conservatively skipped merge) to
      ``normalization_log``.
