"""The second seam: geometry questions that data cannot answer.

Most of what the pipeline needs about a solid is settled once and written
into a :class:`~contract.partmodel.PartModel`.  A handful of questions are
not like that, because *what to ask depends on what recognition has already
decided*: how far this pocket's walls are from that one's, whether the
midpoint of a chord the endpoint traversal just constructed is inside the
material, how much stock is left under a floor this module has just claimed.
Those cannot be precomputed into a JSON file - the query points do not exist
until the layer that asks them has run.

:class:`KernelServices` is the whole of that surface.  The kernel supplies
one implementation (``nxline.kernel``, which drives NX's own routines);
every layer above the seam takes one as an argument and never imports a
kernel package:

===============================  ==========================================
method                           NX routine
===============================  ==========================================
``classify_point``               ``uf.Modeling.TraceARay``
``face_set_distance``            ``MeasureManager.NewDistance``
``remaining_floor_thickness``    ``uf.Modeling.TraceARay``
``min_wall_thickness``           ``uf.Modeling.TraceARay``
``tessellation_bounds``          ``uf.Modeling.AskBoundingBox``
``tessellate``                   ``uf.Facet``
===============================  ==========================================

Static face facts are not asked for here.  A face's interior samples and its
area centroid travel inside :class:`~contract.partmodel.FaceData`
(``interior_samples`` / ``centroid``), filled while the part is open.

Faces are addressed by **raw CAD face id**: the zero-based index of the face
in the kernel's own traversal order, the same integer ``FaceData.merged_from``
and ``cadFaceIds`` already carry.

Refusal is a first-class answer.  An implementation that cannot measure
something returns ``None`` / an empty list / ``POINT_UNAVAILABLE`` and the
caller records a named gap - no method here may guess, and none may raise to
signal "not supported".
