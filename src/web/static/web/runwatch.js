//     than handing over a mesh from a newer build (server.py::if_match_satisfied);
//   * the page says so — this module, one banner with the same words on all
//     three pages, offering the reload rather than performing it.
//
// Nothing here is reloaded under the reviewer's feet.  A ranking or an edit
// path computed against the previous build is still the answer to the
// question that was asked; what the reader must not do is *mistake* it for
// the current one.
