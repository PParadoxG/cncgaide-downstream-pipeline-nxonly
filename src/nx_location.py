"""Where the NX install is on *this* machine, resolved in one place.

Several modules need the answer, and the value must not be spelled out as a
literal in each of them: a machine with NX somewhere else would then have to
be told more than once.

**Resolution order**, highest first:

1. The environment variable named by :data:`ENV_VAR` - it wins, and it is what
   one-off runs and automation use.
2. ``config/nx_local.json`` - the machine-local file, ignored by git.  This is
   the surface a deploying agent fills in: it finds NX, writes one path, and
   the answer survives the shell it was found in.  ``config/nx_local.example.json``
   is the tracked template.
3. The built-in default below.

A malformed or unreadable ``nx_local.json`` falls through to the default rather
than raising: this module is imported at start-up by code that has nothing to
do with NX, and a typo in an optional file must not take the process down with
it.  The malformed file is reported by :func:`local_config_problem` so the
caller that *does* care can say so.

Standard library only, like ``contract`` - it is imported from inside the NX
journal process too, where nothing else of ours is on the path.
