"""The witnesses a relation rule may use: NX's attributes and PartModel topology.

Two sources, and the rules keep them apart:

* **what NX published.**  The access direction and locating point of a feature
  arrive as nine scalars (``X_ORIENTATION_D`` … ``Z_POSITION``); a COAXIAL or
  a HOLE_SPACING edge is arithmetic over those and nothing else, so it needs
  no kernel.
* **what the PartModel says.**  A LOCATED_ON terminal is found by walking the
  rims of a feature's own cylindrical walls and asking which face lies beyond
  an open one — pure topology (``wall_rims`` / ``classify_rim_end`` take a
  PartModel and a face id and know no feature class).

What is deliberately *not* here is a translation.  Which classes are holes is
answered by NX's own family tree (``STEP``, ``HOLES`` are classes NX
declares), never by a list of names we chose.

Coverage, stated rather than hidden.  The terminal resolver has two proofs and
tries them in that order:

* a **cylindrical wall rim** - walk the two rims of each cylindrical wall the
  feature owns and take the open ones.  This is the hole case, and it is first
  because a hole's rim is a stronger statement than a patch boundary: it is
  validated against the wall's own axis and radius.
* a **face-set boundary** - where the feature's own faces stop, the edges they
  share with faces outside the set form closed components, and a component
  whose far side is not a cap is a way out.  This is how a pocket, a slot or a
  boss opens, and it needs no feature semantics: ``face_set_openings`` takes a
  PartModel and a set of face ids.

Whatever neither proves is still named rather than dropped, and a host is
still required to resolve to exactly one owner.
