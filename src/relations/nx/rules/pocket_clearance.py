    """A kernel measurement, because no attribute NX publishes can answer it.

    ``relations.yaml`` defines the quantity as the shortest remaining material
    distance *between the walls* of two POCKETS-family features, so what is
    measured is each pocket's lateral face set — the faces running along its
    own access direction — not its floor.

    There is no shared-host gate, and ``relations.yaml`` says so; the note on
    HOLE_SPACING explains why a common host is not a reliable gate here.

    What the ontology *does* state is that the two wall sets must be
    **separated** - a distance of zero is two pockets touching, which is a
    contact and not a clearance - so a zero reading is refused with a named
    ``contactingFaceSets``.
